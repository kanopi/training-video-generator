```

Creates a screenplay-style beat sheet with:
- Introduction beat
- Step-by-step instructions
- Terminal commands
- Browser actions
- Conclusion beat

### 3. Automate Recording
```bash
/video-automate scripts/video-scripts/your-topic-beat-sheet.md
```

Generates:
- AppleScript for iTerm2 automation
- Bash orchestration scripts
- Browser automation
- Recording control

### 4. Generate Narration
```bash
/video-narrate scripts/video-scripts/your-topic-beat-sheet.md
```

Creates TTS audio:
- Individual clips per beat
- Master audio file
- Proper timing synchronization

### 5. Merge Final Video
```bash
/video-merge your-topic
```

Produces final MP4:
